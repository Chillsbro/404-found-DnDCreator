## D&D Character Creator

First we will explain what the project is about. In our case, intended to help facilitate the creation of characters in the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons (D&D).
Primarily intended for use by new players, but able to be used by everyone.

How to install and how to get started with it. Since the site won't be published, users will have to clone the project and host it on their own computer.<br>
Straight forward process.

Last paragraph will be how to get involved / how to collaborate.<br>
Perhaps notes on features that have been left out, but we think would help smoothen the experience.
